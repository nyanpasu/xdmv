Can't get xdmv to render below other windows consistently on all X environments
without rendering straight to the desktop window. Conky does this, so I'm
guessing it's probably alright to do.

I think I can enable double buffering on the root window, so it should be fine
for running animations as well.

I'll have to use fftw for fourier transforms if I don't want to use my own
implementation. Here is a good example of how to use it:
