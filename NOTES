DONE Renders straight to root window
     Can't get xdmv to render below other windows consistently on all X
     environments without rendering straight to the desktop window. Conky does
     this, so I'm guessing it's probably alright to do.

DONE Use fftw for fourier transforms if I don't want to use my own
     implementation. Here is a good example of how to use it:

     Thanks cava for the help

DONE Use xrandr to get screen size configured automatically
     Using it was a first hand experience that there's no better docs than the
     source itself
DONE Have 2 spectrums per Monitor, for each channel. Each spectrum is independent from the rest.
DONE Enable double buffering on the root window, so it should be fine for
     running animations as well.

TODO Experiment with compositing and hardware acceleration for partial
     transparency and background merging
TODO Support multiple audio streams, not just file input
TODO Consider mpd access
DONE Find bug with wav playback getting wrong data 50% through a song
TODO Add preview for README once it looks okay
TODO Test in environments other than minimal X. Probably won't work well with
     other programs using root.
TODO Reduce scope of global filter states (make them static vars for the filter
     funcs or something)
TODO Add support for more file types
TODO Experiment with direct hardware access if Linux allows this
TODO Add a function for getting audio data from agnostic source
TODO Make sure screen is cleared properly on exit
